This project is an online directory of chemicals in Brazil, you can find all of the requirements here. You can find the video presentation in this link.

In this project, I built:

- The main page, with a link to the results page by clicking the "search" button or the "companies" link in the navbar;
- The search results page, with a list of chemical companies, each with a link to the detail company page;
- The detail company page.

Each of these pages have versions for 3 different screen sizes:

- mobile: up to 768px;
- tablet: up to 1024px;
- desktop: from 1024px.

I followed the guidelines of the given design, including:

- Colors;
- Typographies: font face, size, and weight (used a similar one given the design);
- Layout: composition and space between elements, for the 3 given screen sizes.

In this project I:

- Used semantic HTML tags;
- Used CSS selectors correctly;
- Used HTML elements box model (margin, padding, width, height);
- Used industry-standard tools (flexbox) to place elements in the page;
- Created UIs adaptable to different screen sizes using media queries;
- Applied front-end best practices;
- Used CSS grid and flexbox;
- Used SASS.
